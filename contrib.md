{:toc}

For non-team-members: Feel free to mail ideas and/or feedback. Please
refrain from sending "WHEN IS IT DONE" and such, because we are still
planning things right now.

## Getting Started

If you have real skills and time to contribute to the project, read
this section.

We need people that have skills with:

* Web development (Django)
* Programming/AI (Python, Lisp)

What you need to do:

1. Talk to us (on the mailing list or in IRC) about contributing and
   what you can work on.
2. SUBSCRIBE TO THE MAILING LIST.
3. Get the permissions you need.  You'll need access to Trello and
   write access to either the catalog code or client code.  Ask on IRC
   or on the mailing list.
4. Discuss the project on the mailing list, and keep track of tasks on
   Trello.
