# Project W/a/ifu

## About

Project Waifu is a project dedicated to bring our beloved waifus to
life.

The project consists of two parts.  The website part aims to create a
catalog where users will be able to upload and download asset files that
define different waifus.  The client/AI part aims to create a client can
can load assets and simulate your waifu.
