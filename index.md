# Project W/a/ifu

## About

Project Waifu (name not final) will be an online website where users
will be able to download “assets” on Waifu’s, meaning, if the user has a
waifusim client he can just choose a waifu from a list and the waifusim
client will download pictures, sounds, animations, etc.  From there, the
desktop client will use those files to simulate your waifu.
